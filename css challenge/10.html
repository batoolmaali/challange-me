The term "open source", as used to describe software, 
was first proposed by a group of people in the<span class="origins" >free software movement </span>who were critical of the political agenda and moral philosophy implied in the term "free software"
and sought to reframe the discourse to reflect a more commercially minded position.[3] Moreover,
 the ambiguity of the term "free software" was seen as discouraging business adoption
.[4][5] The group included<span class="origins" > Christine Peterson, Todd Anderson, Larry Augustin, Jon Hall,</span>
Sam Ockman,<span class="origins" > Michael Tiemann</span>  and<span class="origins" >  Eric S. Raymond</span> . Peterson suggested "open source" at a meeting[6]
held at<span class="origins" >  Palo Alto, California,</span> in reaction to<span class="origins" >  Netscape's</span> announcement in January 1998 of
 a source code release for<span class="origins" >  Navigator. Linus Torvalds</span> gave his support the following day,
 and Phil Hughes backed the term in<span class="origins" >  Linux Journal. Richard Stallman,</span> the founder of the free software movement,
initially seemed to adopt the term, but later changed his mind.
[6][7] Netscape released its source code under the<span class="origins" >  Netscape Public License</span> and later under the<span class="origins" >  Mozilla Public License.[8] </span><br>


Raymond was especially active in the effort to popularize the new term. He made the first public call to the free software community to adopt it in February 1998.
[9] Shortly after, he founded The Open Source<span class="origins" >  Initiative </span>in collaboration with<span class="origins" >  Bruce Perens.[6]</span><br>


The term gained further visibility through an event organized in April 1998 by technology publisher<span class="origins" >  Tim O'Reilly.</span>
 Originally titled the "Freeware Summit" and later known as the "Open Source Summit",[10]
 the event was attended by the leaders of many of the most important free and open-source projects,
 including Linus Torvalds,<span class="origins" >  Larry Wall, Brian Behlendorf, Eric Allman, Guido van Rossum, Michael Tiemann, 
   
 Paul Vixie, Jamie Zawinski,</span> and Eric Raymond. At the meeting, alternatives to the term "free software" were discussed. 
 Tiemann advocated "sourceware" as a new term, while Raymond argued for "open source". The assembled developers took a vote,
and the winner was announced at a press conference the same evening.[10]<br>

Many large formal institutions have sprung up to support the development of the<span class="origins" >  open-source software movement,</span> 
including the<span class="origins" >  Apache Software Foundation,</span> which supports community projects such as the open-source framework 
Apache Hadoop and the open-source <span class="origins" > HTTP</span> server<span class="origins" >  Apache HTTP.</span>
